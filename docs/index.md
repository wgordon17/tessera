# Tessera

**No-code multi-agent AI orchestration for full project generation.**

Like mosaic tiles coming together to form a complete picture, Tessera coordinates specialized AI agents to build entire software projects from scratch.

---

## What is Tessera?

Tessera is a CLI tool that orchestrates multiple AI agents to:

- **Generate complete projects** from a simple description
- **Conduct thorough research** and requirement gathering through interactive interviews
- **Plan comprehensively** by breaking complex tasks into parallelizable subtasks
- **Execute in parallel** using a fleet of specialized agents
- **Ensure quality** through automated review, testing, and security phases
- **Document everything** automatically

**No coding required** - just describe what you want to build.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **No-Code Operation**
Define agents using markdown system prompts. No Python coding required.

### 🤝 **Multi-Agent Coordination**
- **Supervisor**: Orchestrates task decomposition and delegation
- **Interviewer**: Evaluates agents and gathers requirements
- **Specialists**: Code reviewers, testers, security experts, and more

### 🚀 **Parallel Execution**
Run multiple agents concurrently with intelligent coordination and conflict resolution.

### 🔍 **Full Observability**
- OpenTelemetry tracing (local JSONL files)
- SQLite metrics (task history, costs, performance)
- Real-time cost tracking
- Agent performance analytics

### 🛠️ **Extensible Tools**
- **Built-in**: File operations, Git, web search, code execution
- **Plugins**: Add custom tools via Python files
- **MCP**: Integrate Model Context Protocol servers

### 💰 **Cost Management**
- Automatic cost calculation for 100+ LLM models
- Configurable budget limits (daily, per-task, per-agent)
- Cost threshold approvals

### 🔒 **Security First**
- Configurable sandboxing (Docker, Podman, uv)
- Risk-based approval gates
- File locking for conflict prevention

### 📊 **Intelligent Agent Selection**
- Performance-based routing
- Adaptive learning from failures
- Interview-driven capability assessment

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
uvx tessera init
```

This creates:
- `~/.config/tessera/config.yaml` - Your configuration
- `~/.config/tessera/prompts/` - Agent system prompts

### First Project

```bash
uvx tessera
```

The interactive wizard will:
1. Ask about your project
2. Interview you for requirements
3. Generate a comprehensive plan
4. Execute with multiple agents in parallel
5. Deliver a complete, tested, documented project

## Example

```bash
$ uvx tessera

? What would you like to build?
> A FastAPI backend with user authentication, PostgreSQL database,
> and comprehensive tests.
