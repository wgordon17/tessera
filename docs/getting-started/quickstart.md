# Quick Start

This tutorial walks you through using Tessera to generate your first project in under 10 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Initialize Configuration

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
uvx tessera init
```

The wizard will ask:
- Which LLM provider to use (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Your API key
- Default agent configuration

This creates `~/.config/tessera/config.yaml`.

---

## Step 2: Generate Your First Project

Start Tessera in interactive mode:

```bash
uvx tessera
```

### Interactive Prompts

```
? What would you like to build?
> A simple Python CLI tool that fetches weather data

? Complexity level: Simple

? Interview mode (recommended for better results)?
> Yes
```

### Interview Phase

The Interviewer agent will ask clarifying questions:

```
Q1/5: Which weather API should we use?
> OpenWeatherMap

Q2/5: What data should be displayed?
> Current temperature, conditions, and 5-day forecast

Q3/5: How should users provide location?
> City name as command-line argument

...
```

### Planning Phase

The Supervisor agent generates a comprehensive plan:

```
✓ Plan generated: 8 tasks across 5 phases
✓ Agents required: 4 (code-architect, python-expert, test-engineer, tech-writer)
✓ Estimated cost: $1.20 | Time: ~45 minutes

Tasks:
  1. Design CLI architecture
  2. Implement weather API client
  3. Create command-line interface
  4. Add error handling
  5. Write unit tests
  6. Write integration tests
  7. Create README documentation
  8. Generate usage examples

## Step 3: Review the Generated Project

```bash
cd weather-cli
cat README.md
```

The README will include:
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Development guide

---

## Step 4: Run the Generated Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Use the CLI
uv run python -m src.cli "San Francisco"
```

---

## Next Steps

### Customize Agents

Edit `~/.config/tessera/prompts/python-expert.md` to customize how the agent writes code.

### Adjust Configuration

Edit `~/.config/tessera/config.yaml` to:
- Add more agents
- Configure cost limits
- Enable tools and plugins
- Set up Slack notifications

### Generate Another Project

```bash
uvx tessera "Build a REST API with FastAPI and PostgreSQL"
```
